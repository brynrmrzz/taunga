          <h3 class="header">Support Talented Ecuadorian Women by Purchasing
            Their Handmade Tauga Jewelry</h3>
          <p class="description">"We've had the pleasure of working with a group
            of incredibly talented Ecuadorian women for the past 7 years,
            promoting their stunning tauga jewelry. Unfortunately, due to the
            ongoing universal health crisis, we haven't been able to participate
            in holiday fairs as we normally would. We know times have been tough
            for everyone, but especially for these women who rely on their craft
            to support themselves and their families. That's why we're reaching
            out to fellow Unitarians who share our commitment to free trade, to
            see if you might be interested in checking out these beautiful
            bracelets. Any support you can offer would mean the world to us and
            to these amazing artisans."</p>

          <h3 class="header">Sustainable Jewelry Making from Ecuadorian Artisans</h3>
          <p class="description">Tauga is a tree that grows in Ecuador which
            produces nuts, similar to coconuts, that when cracked open reveals
            smaller nuts inside that are then harvested and cut with a ban saw
            into all different designs. After these families complete this part,
            other families design and dye the ivory pieces with natural dyes,
            then create the bracelets. It takes 7 families to produce this
            product. The good part is that the tree is not destroyed and is a
            sustainable way for them to continue to earn an income.</p>
